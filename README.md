# Aloha Home Page Project

Check the live version out on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/metaprogrammer93/alohashop.git).

#### Summary

This is a responsive homepage for the Aloha Apparel company.

- Flexbox was used as the primary tool for "floating" all the content. The category grid of images is a great example of this.
- Use the background shorthand property to create a beautiful layered hero banner using a gradient, a background image.
- Smooth scrolling Navigation
- Implement a jquery slider and make it responsive for the Most-Loved Products gallery.

#### Tools Used

- HTML5/CSS3
- Flexbox
- Responsive design *(mobile, tablet, desktop)*
- Javascript
- jQuery

#### Reflections

This project was a great way to explore how amazing Flexbox is. The shop category grid is entirely responsive and built using Flexbox, and the Most-Loved Products slider was built using a jquery plugin. The exploration and understanding of these tools makes future projects much more interesting and dynamic. I also loved playing with the background property -- it's incredibly helpful to be able to layer background assets to create a richer graphic.
